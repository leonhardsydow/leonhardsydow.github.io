At the same time I started to go to university, I also started working at [anarcon](https://anarcon.org). Starting out as what's called a "dual student", something like an apprentice, in 2014 I became a working student in 2018 and a fully fledged IT Consultant in 2020. 

My focus is mostly on the technical aspect of Atlassian applications, doing everything from [simple scripting in Groovy](https://scriptrunner.adaptavist.com/latest/jira/intro-to-groovy.html), to developing custom-tailored Plugins in Java, Kotlin and JS, to setting up Infrastructure as Code with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), and migrating installations between servers, on-premise datacenters and the cloud, the cloud and on-premise datacenters, operating systems, pretty much whatever you can think of.

I'm also well versed with all sorts of plugins ranging from [CMDB-Applications like Insight](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212137/insight-asset-management) to [Business Intelligence Solutions like eazyBI](https://eazybi.com). All of this has been happening in Linux environments - I once migrated Jira instances between Microsoft Servers, but would rather not talk about what it's like to deal with GUI on servers, because it's spooky.

Recently i have also started to branch out into being a full-stack developer, using a tech stack based on Spring Boot in Kotlin for the backend and Angular in the frontend.
