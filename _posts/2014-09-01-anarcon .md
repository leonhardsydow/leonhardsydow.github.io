At the same time I started to go to university, I also started working at [anarcon](https://anarcon.org). Starting out as a "dual student" in 2014, I became a working student in 2018 and a fully fledged IT Consultant in 2020. 

In the beginning my focus was mostly on the technical aspect of Atlassian applications, doing everything from [simple scripting in Groovy](https://scriptrunner.adaptavist.com/latest/jira/intro-to-groovy.html), to developing custom-tailored Plugins in Java, Kotlin and Typescript with React or Angular.

In 2022 I started to transition to becoming a full-stack developer, using a tech stack based on Spring Boot in Kotlin for the backend and Angular in the frontend.
