What's this? This is my Website. I created it using [Jekyll, a static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com) that works well with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), which i use to host this website.

You can find the [source code](https://github.com/leonhardsydow/leonhardsydow.github.io) for it in my Github Account, along with my [other projects](https://github.com/leonhardsydow) - which there aren't a lot of currently, but it's in the works.

This is mostly here to give credit to the technologies used, which include the ones above as well as [the Louie theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/lilykonings/louie) and [tinygraphs for the favicon](http://www.tinygraphs.com#?name=leosydow&shape=labs%2Fisogrids%2Fhexa16&theme=seascape&numcolors=4#tryitout).
